[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based
science competition, where teams of students take tests, conduct labs, and
engineer solutions.

As a member of the national A-Team, I (along with other A-Teamers) develop
educational resources, write exams, and supervise across the nation at all
levels of competition for the space science events: Astronomy, Reach for the
Stars, and Solar System. We are generously supported by [NASA's Universe of
Learning](https://www.universe-of-learning.org/).

We are always looking for new members. If you're eager to help and interested in
joining, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or

### past exams

*select <u>astronomy</u> material from the current* {★} *or past seasons*

Most exams here have <u>walkthrough guides</u> that go through the more
difficult sections in detail and include references to more resources. As a
former competitor, I know how daunting astronomy can seem. I hope the guides are
helpful!

### supervising

*TODO:* I plan to (eventually) write some articles about my workflow as an event
