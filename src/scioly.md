[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based
science competition, where teams of students take tests, conduct labs, and
engineer solutions.

as a member of the national A-Team, i (along with other a-teamers) develop
educational resources, write exams, and supervise across the nation at all
levels of competition for the space science events: astronomy, reach for the
stars, and solar system. we are generously supported by [NASA's Universe of
Learning](https://www.universe-of-learning.org/).

we are always looking for new members. if you're eager to help and interested in
joining, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or
[Donna](mailto:dlyoung.nso@gmail.com)!

### past exams

*select <u>astronomy</u> material from the current* {★} *or past seasons*

most exams here have <u>walkthrough guides</u> that go through the more
difficult sections in detail and include references to more resources. as a
former competitor, i know how daunting astronomy can seem. i hope the guides are
helpful!
