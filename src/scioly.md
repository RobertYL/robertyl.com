[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based
science competition, where teams of students take tests, conduct labs, and
engineer solutions.

As a member of the national A-Team, I (along with other A-Teamers) develop
educational resources, write exams, and supervise across the nation at all
levels of competition for the space science events: Astronomy, Reach for the
Stars, and Solar System.

We are always looking for new members. If you're eager to help and interested in
joining, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or

### past exams

*select <u>Astronomy</u> material from the current* {â˜…} *or past seasons*

Most exams here have <u>walkthrough guides</u> that go through the more
difficult sections in detail and include references to more resources. As a
former competitor, I know how daunting astronomy can seem. I hope the guides are
helpful!
