[Science Olympiad](https://www.soinc.org/) is the nation's largest team-based
science competition, where teams of students take tests, conduct labs, and
engineer solutions.

### space science

As a member of the national A-Team, I (along with other A-Teamers) develop
educational resources, write exams, and supervise across the nation at all
levels of competition for the space science events: Astronomy, Reach for the
Stars, and Solar System.

We are always looking for new members. If you're eager to help and interested in
joining, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or
[Donna](mailto:dlyoung.nso@gmail.com)!

### astronomy

Exams from the 2025-2026 season are listed below. Each one includes a
<u>walkthrough guide</u> that go through the more difficult sections in detail
and include references to more resources. As a former competitor, I know how
daunting astronomy can seem. I hope the guides are helpful!

### machines

The 2025-2026 season brings back Machines, an event focused on simple and
compound machines. Below are some exams from the 2020-2021 season&mdash;the previous
time the event was in rotation. They are roughly ordered in increasing
difficulty, which is how I'd recommend taking them.
