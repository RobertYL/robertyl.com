I'm a first year master's student at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE) studying aerospace engineering. I find [astrodynamics](/research) beautiful and research multi-body dynamics under the guidance of professor [Kathleen Howell](https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1). Beyond academia, I volunteer for [Science Olympiad](/scioly) and occasionally participate in [programming competitions](/compro).
