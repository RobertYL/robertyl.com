### before now

In June of 2024, I graduated summa cum laude from the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) with a double major in aerospace engineering and mathematics of computation. During my time at UCLA, I was a student researcher at [ELFIN](https://elfin.igpp.ucla.edu/) designing the orbits and maneuvers for CEPHEIDS, a future cubesat constellation; an intern at [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/) and [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/); the president for [ACM ICPC at UCLA](https://icpc.uclaacm.com/); and, briefly on the [UCLA Overwatch](https://uclaclubsports.com/sports/overwatch) JV team.
